## General info
The purpose of this project is to implement the data structures and algorithms found in Algorithms, 4th Edition, by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.
	
Assignments from the book website will be included in this project.
 
Assignments completed:
* Percolation - This project models a percolation system. The client program, PercolationStats.py, runs a computational experiment to determine the probability a system will percolate given a site vacancy probability of p. Given the values N and T, the program creates an NxN matrix and completes T trials. After completion, the mean, standard deviation, and 95% confidence interval is generated for the percolation threshold.
## Technologies
Project is created using:
* Python 3.6.7
